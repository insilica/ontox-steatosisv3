Following our last meeting, we would like to request your assistance in testing the auto labeling tool on our project.
Specifically, we would like to try the autolabel on two sets of data: one comprising only Title/abstract and the other consisting of PDFs. (Both datasets have already been manually classified as either included or excluded)

The first dataset containing only Title/abstract comprises the 1412 articles from the "Steatosiv3" project by sysrew, accessible via the following link: https://www.sysrev.com/p/123619  (Please clone this project to avoid modifications to the original)
For this set, we propose to ask the system the following question:
"Mark this article as true for inclusion if it discusses clinical case studies (or case reports or patient cases) of drug-induced liver toxicity (or DILI or hepatotoxicity) and as false for inclusion if it is a review, meta-analysis, trial, animal study, or a cell based study."


Regarding the set of PDFs we have prepared (Due to the size of the files, I will send them to you as .zip in two independent emails that I will send you instantly), coul you please create a new sysrev private project with those articles?
we suggest the following question for the system:
"Mark this article as true for inclusion if it discusses clinical case studies (or case reports or patient cases) of drug-induced liver toxicity (or DILI or hepatotoxicity) that utilize diagnostic techniques such as histopathology (or liver biopsy analysis), computed tomography (or computerized tomography), X-ray, or ultrasound (or ultrasonography), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and as false for inclusion if it is a review, meta-analysis, trial, animal study, or a cell based study."

In both cases, we have provided synonyms for some of the terms used in the questions within parentheses.
Please, feel free to make any change to improve the query and to contact us if you need any clarification about our request.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation!
